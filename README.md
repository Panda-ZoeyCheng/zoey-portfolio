# Acknowledgments
This portfolio was inspired by Judy Gab's Web Development Projects. I am grateful for her work, which provided a strong foundation for my own portfolio. I customized and adapted her code to suit my personal needs, adding unique elements to reflect my style.

A special thanks to her YouTube tutorial (link), which was invaluable in guiding my development process.

Additionally, I referenced her YouTube tutorial（https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYv6BM2fWd8） to guide the development process.
